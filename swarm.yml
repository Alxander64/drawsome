# This was used for early local testing and development
# Actual deployment is done with manifests in /k8s

# Up:    docker stack deploy -c swarm.yml drawsome
# Check: docker stack services drawsome
#        docker service ps drawsome_<frontend|backend|mongodb>
#        docker service logs drawsome_<frontend|backend|mongodb>
# Down:  docker stack rm drawsome

# This setup no longer reflects the production environment
# perfectly. One reverse proxy should be exposed on port 80
# which routes requests correctly to the frontend and backend
# servers. In this environment, requests to the backend must
# specify port 3000, and so relative routes don't work as they
# normally would
